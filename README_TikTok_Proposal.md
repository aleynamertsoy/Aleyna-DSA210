# TikTok Usage Analysis: Trends, Patterns, and User Behavior

## Motivation
TikTok has become one of the most widely used social media platforms, shaping trends, influencing behavior, and engaging users worldwide. This project aims to analyze personal TikTok usage data to uncover insights about usage patterns, engagement trends, and content interaction. By leveraging our own data, we will gain a deeper understanding of how we interact with the platform over time.

## Data Source
The data for this project will be collected directly from the TikTok app:
- **Personal Usage Data**: Downloaded from the TikTok app, including metrics such as time spent, video interactions, and engagement history.
- **Additional Contextual Information**: Manual tracking of additional factors such as the time of day, video categories, and interaction types.

## Data Collection Plan
- Download personal TikTok usage data from the app.
- Process and clean the data for analysis.
- Enrich the dataset with relevant contextual information, such as timestamps and interaction types.

## Analysis Plan
The project will involve the following steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding overall TikTok usage trends.
   - Analyzing engagement patterns (likes, shares, comments).
   - Identifying content preferences based on watch history.

2. **Statistical and Hypothesis Testing**
   - Investigating correlations between usage time and engagement levels.
   - Analyzing patterns in content preferences over different time periods.

3. **Visualization and Insights**
   - Creating data visualizations to illustrate usage patterns.
   - Summarizing key insights from the analysis.

## Expected Outcomes
- A structured dataset of personal TikTok usage data.
- Insights into engagement patterns and content interaction trends.
- A foundation for further analysis in future phases of the project.
